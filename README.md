# Rings

| Ring | Explanation |
|-----:|------|
| **Hold**   | Technology in the hold ring is tech we actively avoid. So items in this ring should not be used for new software and, if possible, we should migrate away from 'hold' technology.    |
| **Assess**   | Technology in the Assess ring are things we are interested in and are considering for production trial. This maps to the discover and assess phases in our process.    |
| **Trial**   | Technology in the Trial ring is technology that we are actively trying out. This is the "implement phase" in our process where we do a proof of concept in a production service / application.   |
| **Adopt**   | Technology in the Adopt ring is software that is part of out target architecture.    |
